songs “Dream on” by Aero Smith I have developed a system for myself, and others willing to learn and implement. It is TEAM method (test,
evaluate, analyze, and model) to live by, I will share this method with who ever wants to learn and understand it. I am willing to build a team,
Train on how to recognize life signs around us with more clarity. Also, gain a better understanding of how to become more

optimistic as we travel on our own spiritual path with confidence and surety.I am vegan who loves nature and its many signs and
wonders. I enjoy star gazing, riding my bike, hiking, kayaking, attending to my pets, farming, flying kites or just baking in the sun. I ran my
first marathon in 22, the Peachtree Road race, this was one of my most personal accomplishment I finished top 28% without training. I am
grateful and thankful for all my spiritual and physical teammates; with this support I will focus on my mission to be an inspirational guiding

the TEAM method, I now know and believe “And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.” By Paulo
Coelho, The Alchemist.
